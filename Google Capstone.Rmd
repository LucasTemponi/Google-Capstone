## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
files <- list.files(path='/cloud/project/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16')
names <- str_split_fixed(files,"_merged",2)[,1]
for (i in names){
  assign(i,read_csv(paste('/cloud/project/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/',i,"_merged.csv",sep="")))
}
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
